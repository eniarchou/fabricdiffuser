LDT Photometric Files — RGB LED SMD5050 Horizontal Measurements

This repository contains photometric LDT (EULUMDAT) files for an SMD5050 RGB LED measured in a horizontal configuration under two different optical conditions:

🔹 smd5050_horizontal_bareLED.ldt

Photometric data of a bare SMD5050 RGB LED without any optical diffusion material.



🔹 smd5050_horizontal_cotton_diffuser.ldt

Photometric data of the same SMD5050 RGB LED measured with a cotton fabric diffuser placed over the emitter.
